# Cafe Management System - Tableau & MySQL

## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing food consumption, inventory usage, and cost optimization in a cafe using **MySQL** for database management and **Tableau** for creating interactive dashboards.  
It helps stakeholders **minimize food wastage**, **monitor inventory usage**, and **optimize operational costs** effectively.

## **Project Components**
- **Dataset (`dataset`):**  
  Contains raw and cleaned data used for analysis.

- **SQL Scripts (`Mysql/`):**  
  Includes database creation scripts, queries for extracting insights, and cost analysis queries.

- **Query Outputs (`results of analytics query/`):**  
  Contains exported results and analysis outputs from SQL queries.

- **Tableau Dashboards:**  
  - Packaged Tableau workbook (`.twbx`): Main dashboards for cost trends and inventory analysis.  
  - Visuals for **weekly/monthly cost trends**, **inventory usage**, and **high/low-cost categories**.

- **EDA & Reports:**  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) files with insights.  
  - Visualization screenshots for quick reference.

## **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **MySQL** – Database creation & analytics queries  
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards & visualizations  
- **Excel/CSV** – Initial data formatting and cleaning
